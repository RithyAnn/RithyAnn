                The YUNYI Go project began development in 2018 and was officially used in professional Go competitions since 2020.
                <br>
                In this project, a Go referee system was developed that determines the outcome by taking a photo of the final game and uploading it.
                <br>
                Image processing and machine learning techniques are used to implement this function. The win or loss is calculated by classifying the colors of the Go pieces in the image and judging and reconstructing their positions.
                <br>
                The project received financial support from the China University Students’ Innovation and Entrepreneurship Program.
                <br>
                The following is the certificate of completion of the project in 2019 after review by the China University Students’ Innovation and Entrepreneurship Program Committee.
