        <div class="container">
            <p>
                The System And Equipment For Computer-Aided Retinopathy Detection project started in 2019 and is carried out by the same team as the YUNYI GO (Go Referee System Based On Computer Vision And Machine Learning) project.
                <br>
                This project aims to provide efficient and low-cost testing methods for diabetic retinopathy in poor and medically backward areas.
                <br>
                We simultaneously developed a retinal image acquisition device and a retinal image analysis and processing network.
                <br>
                In this project, my main job is to participate in the construction of neural networks.
                <br>
                The project also received financial support from the China University Students’ Innovation and Entrepreneurship Program.
                <br>
                This project has achieved considerable results in The 5th China International College Students’ “Internet+” Innovation and Entrepreneurship Competition and the Challenge Cup.
